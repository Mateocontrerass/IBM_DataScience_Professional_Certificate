# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository showcases my projects and assignments from the __IBM Data Science Professional Certificate__. Check the README subsections for insights into what I've learned from each course. Dive into the code, ask questions, and explore my hands-on experience with data science techniques, including SQL, Python, and more.



### Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python ( SQL Data Analysis)

In this course, I mastered:

- **String Patterns:** Efficient manipulation and extraction of information from text data.
- **Subqueries:** Breakdown of complex queries for enhanced flexibility and readability.
- **SQL Magic and SQLite Python Library:** Seamless integration of SQL queries into Python scripts and notebooks.
- **Data Analysis with Python:** Practical application of Python's data manipulation and visualization alongside SQL.

For the final assignment, I worked with real-world datasets from Chicago, answering questions to demonstrate my SQL proficiency and data interpretation skills. Explore the notebooks for insights into my approach and solutions.
