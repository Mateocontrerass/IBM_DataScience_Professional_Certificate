Hello, I will be uploading all the content related to the Data Science certification course from IBM such as Homework and various projects.



### Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

In this course, I mastered:

- **String Patterns:** Efficient manipulation and extraction of information from text data.
- **Subqueries:** Breakdown of complex queries for enhanced flexibility and readability.
- **SQL Magic and SQLite Python Library:** Seamless integration of SQL queries into Python scripts and notebooks.
- **Data Analysis with Python:** Practical application of Python's data manipulation and visualization alongside SQL.

For the final assignment, I worked with real-world datasets from Chicago, answering questions to demonstrate my SQL proficiency and data interpretation skills. Explore the notebooks for insights into my approach and solutions.
