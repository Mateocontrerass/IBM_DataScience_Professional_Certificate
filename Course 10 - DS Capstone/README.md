# ðŸš€ IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone


The Applied Data Science Capstone is the last course of the
[IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). In this course we will 
summarize all the knowledge we have acquired throughout the specialization in a single project.

## ðŸ“– About the project

SpaceX's competitive edge lies in its reusable Falcon 9 rocket. By reusing the first stage, they achieve significant cost savings compared to competitors
(SpaceX: $62 million vs. Competitors: >$165 million per launch). To optimize reusability and maximize cost savings, this project aims to predict if
a SpaceX launch will result in a successful first-stage landing. We will leverage publicly available data and machine learning models to achieve this goal.

## ðŸ“– Key questions

- What are the key variables that determine if a landing will be successful?
- Has the succesfull landing rate changed over the years?
- What place have the company made more successfull landings at?
- What model works the best to determine if a landing be successfull?

## ðŸ“–  Methodology

1. **Data collection**
   - Space X Rest API
   - WebScrapping the Space X wikipedia site
2. **Data Wrangling**
   - Filtering data using Pandas API
   - Handling missing values
   - One hot encoding for categorical variables
3. **Explotaroty Data Analysis**
   - SQL Magic and Matplotlib to get insights on data
4. **Interactive visual analytics**
   - Folium and Plotly dash to make maps and an interactive dashboard
5. **Predictive analytics**
   - Build, train and evaluate different classification models to get the best results on the goal of the project.
